            <p>React-Formable is a form library that gets out of your way. It makes no assumptions on schemas, inputs, structure, or favorite foods.</p>

            <p>Inspired by functional libraries such as <a href="http://ramdajs.com/" target="_blank">ramdajs</a>, react-formable favors predictable discrete components which you compose together to build complex forms. Nested forms? List forms? Conditional forms that behave certain ways on the full moon? No problem, react-formable has your back.</p>
